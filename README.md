Resubmission of VBA Challenge from Wk2:

Instructions Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information: #The ticker symbol #Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter. #The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter. #The total stock volume of the stock.

I have add functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image: Hard solution - Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

NOTE - Conditional formatting has been used to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

#I have attached the file, VBA script, schreen shots and Read Me. I worked with my son to get the information to work properly.
